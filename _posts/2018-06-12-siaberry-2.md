This is the second half of my post from yesterday about Siaberry, a seller of hardware and software tools to earn money on the Sia network. Yesterday's post discussed Sia's numerous security vulnerabilties. In today's post, I'm going to highlight Siaberry's questionable business practices.

# You won't make a profit with Siaberry

My biggest issue with Siaberry is that they advertise their product as a way to make money when customers clearly won't.

Anyone familiar with Sia can tell you that Sia hosts barely earn money. If people have spare hardware lying around, *maybe* they can earn a few dollars per month. Siaberry sells a hosting kit with a price tag so high, it's a near-certainty that their customers won't make a profit.

Reddit user /u/Starbuckz8 regularly posts his host revenue numbers, and in his [most recent update](https://redd.it/819t29), he was earning 11 SC (~$0.23) per day on a 3.7 TB Sia host. Siaberry sells an 8 TB kit for $500. Even making the generous assumption that the 8 TB Siaberry would earn double /u/Starbucks8's revenue, it would take 3 years just to earn back your hardware investment. It would take even longer if you take into account electricity costs.

But Siaberry sells customers the idea that they'll make a profit if they buy a Siaberry. You can see this clearly in Siaberry's recent tech talk, which is basically a 20-minute sales pitch from their CEO, Sebuh Honarchian. Throughout the video Sebuh misstates several key facts about Sia or omits relevant details to give the audience the impression that they can earn money by purchasing Siaberry devices.

>3:30 - The data usage is pretty rapid. The Siacoin users have been increasing the amount of data that they're putting onto the network every day. So it's kind of like going like this [mimes a steep curve]... the amount data usage. And it's constantly getting faster and faster. So there's going to be a demand for Siaberry in the near future and even now.

At the time of this talk, storage demand was growing, but not quite as dramatically as Sebuh implied. Usage of the Sia network grew from 73.92 TB to 221 TB in six months. This represents 16% growth rate month-over-month, which is healthy but hardly the exponential growth rocket ship that Sebuh paints.

{% include image.html file="used-storage.png" alt="SiaStats chart of Sia usage" img_link="true" max_width="700px" %}

Sebuh neglected to mention that Sia's total capacity at the time was 4 PB, meaning that a staggering 95% of Sia's existing host capacity was sitting unsold:

{% include image.html file="used-percentage.png" alt="SiaStats chart of Sia usage percentage" img_link="true" max_width="700px" %}

While he doesn't mention the excess capacity, he does make an argument for why customers should buy a Siaberry ahead of renter demand:

>4:00 - When you start hosting, the network doesn't trust you because you have a age penalty, and you're brand new on the network, nobody trusts you. So, like, after a while, you've been on the network online 100%, for like, three months, then your age penalty is removed. So, if you want to be making money three months from now, you have to start today.

Sebuh is correct that Sia applies an age penalty to new hosts, but the penalty reduces to zero [after 41 days](https://siawiki.tech/host/scoring_system#host_age), not three months:

{% include image.html file="age-penalties.png" alt="Sia age penalties" img_link="true" max_width="582px" %}

>10:54 - There's 78,000 active contracts on the network right now. That means there's 78,000 people that have signed up to use Siacoin as a storage platform.

This is completely incorrect. Storage contracts are not the same as storage *users*. Each Sia user has 50 contracts minimum, but a user's contract count can grow to over 100.

I'd estimate that 78,000 active contracts represents about 1,000 users. Even that figure is misleadingly high because it includes users who experimented with Sia at any point in the prior three months regardless of whether they're still active users.

>11:50 - Our goal at Siaberry Incorporated is to reach 50% of the network's total storage. The way we're going to do that is by launching another 895 Siaberries [***ed**: At the time, only 30 Siaberries were online*]. 
>
>If we double the size of the network, Siacoin will become more appealing for- y'know enterprise-grade clients. That's what we really want. We want *big* like companies like Walmart that generate like terabytes and terabytes of just receipt transactions a second.

Again, Sia's total capacity was 4 PB. If Walmart was generating "terabytes" of data per second (a claim I was unable to verify), that's at least 86 PB per day. If Siaberry devices doubled Sia's network capacity to 8 PB, Sia would still be completely irrelevant to a company like Walmart, whose storage needs are likely measured in zettabytes (millions of petabytes).

# $234 of hardware in a $500 box

Siaberry's flagship product is their "Siacoin Hosting Contract Harvester" kit. It's a set of hardware parts that allows customers to build their own Siaberry hosting nodes.

{% include image.html file="siaberry-harvester.png" alt="Screenshot of Siabery harvester sales page" border="true" img_link="true" max_width="650px" %}

If you give Siaberry $500, they'll send you four items that you could have purchased on Amazon for less than half the price:

| Item | Price |
|-------|--------|
| [Raspbery Pi kit](http://a.co/ixdsZGl) | $54.99 |
| [Seagate 8TB external drive](http://a.co/iLU6kQ8) | $ 159.99 |
| [SanDisk Ultra 16GB MicroSD card](http://a.co/2HYNKSG) | $8.59 |
| [SanDisk 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash drive](http://a.co/1DHM5Oy) | $10.99 |
| **Total** | **$234.56** |

As far as I can tell, the value-add that Siaberry gives their customers in exchange for that $265.44 profit margin is:

* They put together your Raspberry Pi case for you (a process that takes about 30 seconds).
* They write the (free) SiaberryOS image to the microSD card for you.
* They bootstrap the USB key with the Sia blockchain so you wait less time for it to download.

# Open source, but where's the source?

SiaberryOS was released almost a year ago, on July 27th, 2017. As any savvy cryptocurrency consumers would, Sia users [asked to see source code](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/6pzfeh/introducing_siaberryos_a_linux_operating_system/dku2biq/?st=ji4qrg5m&sh=cfea8152). Siaberry developer Kete Tefid responded:

>I declare that SiaBerryOS *is* open source! Exactly like its father i.e., Gentoo. Actually, it is just that I have not finished uploading the project to github.
>
>...
>
>Rest assured that it was being developed with being opensource in mind from the beginning. It *is* and *will always be*.
>
>-Kete Tefid, Siaberry developer

So it's open source, just without the source?

Note that Siaberry released the SiaberryOS under the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which states:

>Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that **you receive source code or can get it if you
want it**, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

Users returned to the thread for weeks asking Kete when he would publish the source. A month later, [he replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/6pzfeh/introducing_siaberryos_a_linux_operating_system/dm8thba/?st=ji4qgguu&sh=883932eb):

>The process of creating the repository is going to take time as over months I changed files. Remember that Gentoo is a source-based, meta distribution which means you will not find the source code of most of the programs used in the Siaberry github. It will consist of a directory of ebuilds by which you can manage to replicate the project. In fact, it will just direct you how to build the OS.
>
>-Kete Tefid, Siaberry developer

This is all pretty much nonsense. Changing the contents of a file doesn't make it any harder to publish. His response suggests that there's no real source to SiaberryOS because building the image is just a matter of executing the right commands to pull open source code from existing sources. except for executing commands, but this is untrue. The OS itself contains many built-in
In order for Kete to build the SiaberryOS image, those files have to exist somewhere, but he has not published them.

The [web app source](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerry-WebUI) is published, but the additional files on the OS are not.

Seven months after Siaberry's initial "open-source" release, Siaberry published a [FAQ](https://redd.it/809szk), which included this:

>**Q: Is SiaBerryOS open-sourced?**
>
>A: Yes, from the developer “The project has been open source from the very first beginning. It is just that I have been very busy developing it further so I have not been able to release the repository.” SiaberryOS can be found on github.

At the time of this writing, there is nothing on the [SiaberryOS Github](https://github.com/ketetefid/SiaBerryOS) except a compiled image that's two versions out of date:

# Siaberry deploys unstable versions of Sia

In the `#siaberry` channel of Sia's Discord server, Kete mentioned that instead of using official releases, Siaberry simply downloads the latest in-progress code from Sia's source tree and builds that. I checked my Siaberry device and found a cron job that downloads the latest code from Sia's `master` branch on Github and replaces the device's copy of Sia with the newly-built binary.

This is a very dangerous practice. Code in Sia's master branch has not gone through rigorous testing. Bugs in pre-release code could cause users to lose funds or corrupt their data.

I reported this to Siaberry on 2018-03-30. Kete claimed that because the Sia documentation includes [instructions for building from source](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia#building-from-source), it is therefore safe to deploy in-progress versions of Sia to customer devices.

{% include image.html file="pre-release-warning.png" alt="I warn Siaberry of the dangers of deploying unreleased Sia versions to production" img_link="true" max_width="415px" %}

I pointed out that even when the Sia developers invite users to test beta releases, they advise against deploying to production. Kete's response was, "Sorry but we need official word on this. Of course, if they say so, we will change the behavior."

At that point, I looped in David Vorick, Sia's lead developer. He confirmed that Siaberry should not deploy pre-release builds to production:

{% include image.html file="pre-release-to-prod.png" alt="Sia's lead developer tells Siaberry not to release pre-release versions to prod" img_link="true" max_width="723px" %}

This discussion happened more than two months ago. Siaberry still deploys the latest bleeding-edge, untested Sia code to their customer devices with no regard to the increased risk this introduces.

# Siaberry markets to the "get rich quick" crowd

Siaberry's Sales Manager, Isabelo Pasqual, recently published a video in which he makes a direct appeal to people interested in multi-level marketing schemes (also referred to as "MLM schemes" or "pyramid schemes"):

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsiaberryinc%2Fvideos%2F176961052947507%2F&show_text=0&width=640" width="640" height="385" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>

>1:10 - For those of you who are interested in the crypto cloud mining MLMs that are so popular now, imagine this: instead of being on the 500th tier of a downline, what if you were on the top of your own upline? And then you were controlling the mining pool. So that's something we can give you.

>-Isabelo Pasqual, Siaberry Sales Manager

To be clear, Siaberry does not use multi-level marketing, but it should give you pause when a company basically says, "Hey! Are you someone who's easily fooled by get rich quick schemes? Then come check out our services!"

# Final thoughts

This is a device that asks you to trust it with hundreds to securely store hundreds to thousands of dollars worth of crypto.
