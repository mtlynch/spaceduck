Last month, I [announced](/sia-load-test-preview/) the first ever load test of Sia. The load test consists of three distinct Sia scenarios and edge cases. Today, I'd like to share the result of the first test case, in which I uploaded thousands of 1-byte files to Sia.

This test case is meant to capture the lower-bound of Sia's performance. Because Sia splits files into ~40 MiB chunks, each 1-byte file requires ~40 MiB of overhead. This test case should yield Sia's worst-case performance.

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|---------|---------|
| Total file data stored | 47.2 KiB |
| Total bytes uploaded | 9.8 TiB |
| Total files uploaded | 48,358 |
| Total file contracts created | 60 |
| Total spent | 3625 SC /  $50.75\* |
| $ per TB | $1.1 billion (yes, really)\*\* |
| Total test time | 596.8 hours (24.9 days) |
| Average upload bandwidth | 0.00000018 Mbps file data<br />40.3 Mbps total bytes including Sia overhead |
| Final contract count | 60 |
| Sia crashes | 0 |

\* Using the 2018-03-11 price of 1.4 cents per SC. Assumes that unused renter funds will successfully return to the test wallet at the conclusion of the renter contracts.

\*\* Cost per TB is ludicrously high because this particular test case optimizes for high file count at the expense of efficient storage.

## Highlights



## Upload bandwidth

Of all the results so far, I was most surprised by upload bandwidth. The test uploaded 47.2 KiB of file data in 596.8 hours. That's equivalent to an upload bandwidth of 1.8 x 10<sup>-7</sup> Mbps.

That result doesn't mean much because this test case is designed to use Sia inefficiently. The more interesting result is the total number of bytes uploaded: 9.8 TiB, for an effective bandwidth of 40.3 Mbps.

Note that this upload bandwidth is not It's important to note that Sia's upload bandwidth is Note that because Sia handles file replication on the client side, as opposed to Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage who handle it server side. This means that 40.3 Mbps on Sia is equivalent to   an upload bandwidth of ~8-13 Mbps on Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage


If I assume the total uploaded bytes would be the same with optimal file sizes (minimizing Sia overhead), Sia still uploads file data at 3x redundancy, meaning that the most file data Sia could upload with XX.X TiB of total uploaded bytes would be ~ YY.Y TiB. At this rate, uploading 10 TiB of data would take about 3 months.

I'll have a better understanding of Sia's effective upload bandwidth on real data in the next test case, but so far, I expect this will be the biggest obstacle for enterprise adoption.

## Cost

In this test, Sia lost a *ton* of money due to bugs. The cost per TB was, as mentioned above, $1.1 **billion**, but that's not so interesting because 

It is interesting how much money Sia lost in this test due to Sia bugs. I estimate that XX% of the 3625 SC spent in this test was actually due to bugs.

The biggest loss came from [bug #2772](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/2772), which I discovered in a [previous post](/sia-metrics-collector/#incorrect-funds-balance). This bug caused a loss of 2,033.3 SC, which accounts for a whopping 56.1% of the total amount spent in the course of the test.

Cost was the most surprising result of this test. I estimate that 

The biggest source of loss is due to , which I reported during development of the load testing software. As a Sia user spends money on contracts, their money should flow from their wallet's available balance to their renter's total contract spending. This is sort of like moving money from your savings account to your checking account. If you have $5000 in savings and transfer $100 to checking, the total value of both accounts should remain a fixed $5000.

Sia also lost money due to [poor contract management](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/2769), which I've reported prevously, but this case showed a particularly flagrant example.

{% include image.html file="renter-spending.png" alt="Graph of renter spending over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - Renter spending" img_link="true" %}

The purple line shows the amount remaining in Sia's storage contracts still available for upload, download, and storage. In theory, Sia shouldn't form new contracts until this line reaches near zero, but throughout the test, Sia purchases new contracts even with ~1000 SC left in unused renter spending. Perhaps this is Sia just trying to keep at least 50 good contracts at all times as it discovers which of its original contract set contracts are bad.

The graph shows something interesting around the 400 hour mark. Until that point, Sia has 1,766.7 SC in wallet balance that it has not allocated to contracts. All of a sudden, it spends all of its remaining wallet balance on new contracts. In doing so, Sia lost 69.3 SC in contract fees.

I thought perhaps this was just Sia planning ahead and renewing its contracts, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The `/renter/contracts` API showed that contracts began at block 141743 with a renew window of 6480, meaning that contract renewal should happen at block 148223, which hasn't happened yet.

```json
{
    "currentperiod": 141743,
		...
    "settings": {
        "allowance": {
            "funds": "5000000000000000000000000000",
            "hosts": 50,
            "period": 12960,
            "renewwindow": 6480
        }
    }
}
```

## API latency

{% include image.html file="api-latency.png" alt="Graph of API latency over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - API Latency" img_link="true" %}

Sia has notably bad latency, sometimes taking as many as seven minutes to gather metrics from three APIs. I wish I had collected the latency for each API call in isolation. I suspect most of the latency is coming from the `/renter/files` API.

## Sia bugs observed

## Flaws in test design

Having run this test, I now realize I made some big mistakes in designing the test parameters. I expected Sia to either reach 10 TB of upload or completely die in a few days.

For the sake of consistency, I'm going to run the remaining two scenarios of the load test under the same parameters, but I will terminate each test case after 10 days of data collection.

### Unrealistic bandwidth minimum

The test plan required that the Sia would continue as long as Sia continued to make forward progress, where "forward progress" is defined as at least 3 Mbps of upload, averaged over the past hour. This is far too low a threshold. At this rate, it would take over nine days to upload a 100 GB file through Sia.

**Proposed fix**: Set the bandwidth requirement to the minimum required to satisfy Sia's target user. For example, a business customer would likely need to upload about 1 TB or data per day

### Parallelism

When I assumed that each test case would take a day or two, designing it to run on my home machine wasn't a big deal. Now that I've discovered how long the test can run, I realize I should have put more effort into designing it to run on cloud VMs.

**Proposed fix**: Modify

## Test notes

There were two times during the test that the metrics collector crashed, so metrics are missing for a few hours in those chunks.

I started collecting metrics every 60 seconds, but as the API latency increased, I decreased the frequency of metrics collection more and more to a maximum of once per 5 minutes.
