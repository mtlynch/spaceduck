Last month, I [announced](/sia-load-test-preview/) the first ever load test of Sia. The load test consists of three distinct Sia scenarios and edge cases. Today, I'd like to share the result of the first test case, in which I uploaded thousands of 1-byte files to Sia.

This test case is meant to capture the lower-bound of Sia's performance. Because Sia splits files into ~40 MiB chunks, each 1-byte file requires ~40 MiB of overhead. This test case should yield Sia's worst-case performance.

## Cutting the test short

I decided to cut this test short at around the 25-day mark even though the test had not met any of the exit conditions defined in the test plan. At the rate it was going, it could have taken months to complete. The load test results are probably not going to be very relevant to anyone at that point, so I cut it off so that I could keep moving forward with these tests.

For the remaining two test cases, I'm adding an additional exit criteria to keep tests from running forever: the maximum runtime is 14 days.

\* Using the 2018-03-11 price of 1.4 cents per SC. Assumes that unused renter funds will successfully return to the test wallet at the conclusion of the renter contracts.

\*\* Cost per TB is ludicrously high because this particular test case optimizes for high file count at the expense of efficient storage.

## Efficiency

On Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, costs are fairly straightforward. If you upload a 5 GB file, you pay for 5 GB of upload bandwidth and 5 GB of storage for each month the provider keeps your file.

Sia differs from traditional cloud storage providers in that the cost to the user depends on how efficienty Sia stores their files. Under optimal efficiency, Sia uploads each byte of data exactly once per degree of replication. So if you're using Sia's default redundancy of 3x, uploading a 5 GB file would ideally cost you 15 GB for upload and 15 GB for storage.

In practice, Sia can't achieve its optimal efficiency due to two main factors: file padding and bad hosts. 

Sia breaks files into equal chunks of ~40 MiB. For files not perfectly divisible by the chunk size, Sia pads the last chunk so that it will fill the full ~40 MiB size. This is why thousands of 1-byte files are Sia's worst case scenario: each chunk only contains a single byte of actual data and ~40 MiB of padding.

Bad hosts also drive up costs for the user. If you upload a 5 GB file to a host, then that host goes offline, you lose the money you gave to that host and you have to spend more money uploading the data to a new host to get back to 3x replication.

My expectation for this test was that Sia would require about 120 MiB (40 MiB x 3x redundancy) of costs to upload each 1-byte file. Instead, Sia consumed 213 MiB worth of costs to upload each file, for a overhead : data ratio of 220 million to one.

It looks like Sia used a [much higher replication](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/2813#issuecomment-372144990) than it should have. Instead of the 3x replication that I expected, Sia uploaded most files to 5.3x redundancy. One file was uploaded with 11.3x redundancy. I suspect this is due to bugs in Sia because it's very unlikely that so many of hosts went offline in a matter of weeks.

## Cost

The cost per TB per month was, as mentioned above, $350 **million**. This is funny, but not surprising given that this test case measures Sia's performance on its worst case input. The overhead of Sia was 220 million to one. In other words, to store each 1-byte file, Sia uploaded 213.3 MiB of data.

It's a  It would actually be impossible to even upload 1 TB of 1-byte files to Sia because the cost would be around 75 billion Siacoins, which is almost three times larger than the total number fo Siacoins in circulation.

**XX% of costs were due to bugs in Sia**. Interestingly, most of the costs in this test case were actually due to Sia bugs. I estimate that they accounted for XX% of the 3625 SC spent in this test.

The biggest loss came from [bug #2772](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/2772), which I discovered in a [previous post](/sia-metrics-collector/#incorrect-funds-balance). This bug caused a loss of 2,033.3 SC, which accounts for a whopping 56.1% of the total amount spent in the course of the test.

The biggest source of loss is due to , which I reported during development of the load testing software. As a Sia user spends money on contracts, their money should flow from their wallet's available balance to their renter's total contract spending. This is sort of like moving money from your savings account to your checking account. If you have $5000 in savings and transfer $100 to checking, the total value of both accounts should remain a fixed $5000.

{% include image.html file="funds-balance.png" alt="Graph of renter funds balance over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - Funds split between wallet balance and total contract spending" img_link="true" %}

When I shared this result previously, some readers asked whether this loss was simply due to contract fees. It's a reasonable question, but the answer is no. Total contract spending includes contract fees, so the sum of wallet balance and total contract spending should remain constant for the lifetime of the contracts.

Sia also lost money due to [poor contract management](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/2769), which I've reported prevously, but this case showed a particularly flagrant example.

{% include image.html file="renter-spending.png" alt="Graph of renter spending over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - Renter spending" img_link="true" %}

The purple line shows the amount remaining in Sia's storage contracts still available for upload, download, and storage. In theory, Sia shouldn't form new contracts until this line reaches near zero, but throughout the test, Sia purchases new contracts even with ~1000 SC left in unused renter spending. Perhaps this is Sia just trying to keep at least 50 good contracts at all times as it discovers which of its original contract set contracts are bad.

The graph shows something interesting around the 400 hour mark. Until that point, Sia has 1,766.7 SC in wallet balance that it has not allocated to contracts. All of a sudden, it spends all of its remaining wallet balance on new contracts. In doing so, Sia lost 69.3 SC in contract fees.

I thought perhaps this was just Sia planning ahead and renewing its contracts, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The `/renter/contracts` API showed that contracts began at block 141743 with a renew window of 6480, meaning that contract renewal should happen at block 148223, which hasn't happened yet.

```json
{
    "currentperiod": 141743,
		...
    "settings": {
        "allowance": {
            "funds": "5000000000000000000000000000",
            "hosts": 50,
            "period": 12960,
            "renewwindow": 6480
        }
    }
}
```

## Upload bandwidth

The test uploaded 47.2 KiB of file data in 596.8 hours. That's equivalent to an upload bandwidth of 1.8 x 10<sup>-7</sup> Mbps, which is insanely slow, but that's expected for this test of worst case performance.

In this test, most of the data uploaded was actually padding to bring the 1-byte test files up to Sia's minimum data chunk size of ~40 MiB. Including padding, Sia uploaded 9.8 TiB, equivalent to 40.3 Mbps upload bandwidth.

The graphs below show Sia's total bandwidth over time:

{% include image.html file="upload-bandwidth.png" alt="Graph of upload bandwidth over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - Upload bandwidth" img_link="true" %}

This load test is explicitly non-rigorous for measuring bandwidth, as I ran the test on my home FiOS connection while using the Internet for my normal daily activities. I derived bandwidth from Sia's own reported metrics, which are imprecise due to effects of API latency (I'll discuss this more below). That said, we can still make interesting observations about the upload bandwidth.

**Upload bandwidth declines rapidly as more data is uploaded**. Sia reached 200 Mbps for the first few hours, then rapidly declined to an average of ~50 Mbps. As the test continued, the average continued dropping until it was running at ~8 Mbps in the last few days of the test.

**Upload bandwidth is bursty**. The graph shows a declining curve with intermittent spikes. Some measurements reached as high as 600 Mbps, which I think is measurement error due to API latency effects (discussed below). The 60-minute moving average, represented by the green line is more credible, as it shows uploads reaching bandwidths of 100 Mbps and above for brief periods of a few hours.

Bursts are also visible in the graph of absolute bytes uploaded over time. The total data uploaded shows a mix of smooth curves and steep jumps when the upload bandwidth rapidly increases.

## API latency

{% include image.html file="api-latency.png" alt="Graph of API latency over time" fig_caption="Sia 1.3.1 Load Test&#58; Worst Case - API Latency" img_link="true" %}

Sia has notably bad latency, sometimes taking as many as seven minutes to gather metrics from three APIs. I wish I had collected the latency for each API call in isolation. I suspect most of the latency is coming from the `/renter/files` API.

## Sia bugs observed

## Flaws in test design

Having run this test, I now realize I made some big mistakes in designing the test parameters. I expected Sia to either reach 10 TB of upload or completely die in a few days.

For the sake of consistency, I'm going to run the remaining two scenarios of the load test under the same parameters, but I will terminate each test case after 10 days of data collection.

### Unrealistic bandwidth minimum

The test plan required that the Sia would continue as long as Sia continued to make forward progress, where "forward progress" is defined as at least 3 Mbps of upload, averaged over the past hour. This is far too low a threshold. At this rate, it would take over nine days to upload a 100 GB file through Sia.

**Proposed fix**: Set the bandwidth requirement to the minimum required to satisfy Sia's target user. For example, a business customer would likely need to upload about 1 TB or data per day

### Parallelism

When I assumed that each test case would take a day or two, designing it to run on my home machine wasn't a big deal. Now that I've discovered how long the test can run, I realize I should have put more effort into designing it to run on cloud VMs.

**Proposed fix**: Modify

## Test notes

There were two times during the test that the metrics collector crashed, so metrics are missing for a few hours in those chunks.

I started collecting metrics every 60 seconds, but as the API latency increased, I decreased the frequency of metrics collection more and more to a maximum of once per 5 minutes.
