In February, I [announced](/sia-load-test-preview/) the first ever load test of Sia. The load test consists of three distinct test cases:

1. [Worst-case scenario](/load-test-1) (published 2018-03-15)
2. [Real data scenario](/load-test-2) (published 2018-03-23)
3. **Best-case scenario (this report)**

## Results summary

| Metric | Value |
|---------|---------|
| Total uploaded | 1.5 TiB (file bytes)<br />7.2 TiB (absolute bytes) |
| Storage efficiency | 21.5% |
| Total files uploaded | 40,552 |
| Total file contracts created | 68 |
| Total spent | 1,840 SC<br />$25.21\* USD |
| $ per TB/month | $10.36\*\* |
| Total test time | 336.0 hours (14.0 days) |
| Average upload bandwidth | 11.2 Mbps (file data)<br />52.2 Mbps (absolute) |
| Sia crashes | 0 |
| Sia version | 1.3.1 |
| Test OS | Win10 x64 |

\* Based on Siacoin value at test start (1.370 cents per SC). Assumes that unused renter funds will successfully return to the test wallet at the conclusion of the renter contracts.

\*\*Assumes that a standard renter contract lasts 2.77 months. Excludes bandwidth costs.

## File bytes vs. absolute bytes

*(feel free to skip this if you read this in the [previous report](/load-test-2))*

On traditional cloud storage providers like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, there is a 1:1 ratio between the size of your files and the amount of data for which you are billed. If you upload 100 GiB of files, you pay for 100 GiB of upload bandwidth and for 100 GiB of storage space.

Sia's costs are more complicated. If you upload 100 GiB of files, the best you can hope for is to pay for 300 GiB in bandwidth and storage (due to Sia's 3x replication). In practice, the cost is not easily predictable, as it depends on how efficiently Sia repackages your files and how reliable your hosts are.

To keep the semantics clear, I introduce two terms for distinguishing between these metrics:

**File bytes** is the total number of bytes in files uploaded to Sia.

**Absolute bytes** is the total amount of data uploaded to hosts, including Sia metadata, file padding, and redundant copies of the data.

If you upload a 100 GiB file and it causes to Sia upload 350 GiB to hosts, that represents a 100 GiB increase in file bytes and a 350 GiB increase in absolute bytes.

## File data bandwidth vs. absolute bandwidth

*(feel free to skip this if you read this in the [previous report](/load-test-2))*

Because of the distinction between file bytes and absolute bytes, a similar disambiguation is required for bandwidth. In this report, I distinguish between file data bandwidth and absolute bandwidth.

The simplest way to explain them is through an example:

1. User uploads a 500 MB file to Sia.
1. Sia breaks this file into 12 equally-sized chunks of ~42 MB each, totaling ~504 MB.
1. Sia uploads each chunk to three different hosts.
1. All uploads complete after 40 seconds.

The file data bandwidth is simply the size of the file divided by the upload duration:

```text
= 500 MB / 40 seconds
= 4000 Mb / 40 seconds
= 100 Mbps
```

The absolute bandwidth is the total amount of data transferred divided by the upload duration:

```text
= ((42 MB * 12 chunks) * 3 hosts) / 40 seconds
= ((504 MB) * 3 hosts) / 40 seconds
= 1512 MB / 40 seconds
= 12096 Mb / 40 seconds
= 302.4 Mbps
```

## File data bandwidth is what matters

If you have 50 TiB of data to upload to Sia, and you want to know how long this will take, that's the file data bandwidth.

The absolute data bandwidth is useful to guide Sia developers in designing their upload algorithms, but it is not directly relevant to users.

In this report, I focus on file data bandwidth.

## Input data

...

## Test machine crash

At 2018-04-01 at 12:47:56Z (249.5 hours into testing), my Windows test machine crashed. I rebooted it and resumed the load test a few minutes later, but you'll see in the graphs below that this crash had a significant impact on results.

I was unable to analyze the Windows crash dump, and I don't have any evidence that the crash was caused by Sia. My desktop does crash roughly once per month, so this was not out of the ordinary.

This crash does complicate the results, but it also revealed interesting behavior in Sia.

## Storage efficiency

To measure how well Sia stores data, I created the metric of "storage efficiency," which is simply the file bytes divided by the absolute bytes.

On traditional cloud storage providers, efficiency is 100% because you pay for exactly the size of your files. On Sia, the best possible efficiency is 33.3% because Sia uploads every byte of file data at least three times for redundancy. Other factors can degrade efficiency, such as inefficient repackaging of files or unreliable hosts.

**Efficiency was stable at 33% for most of the test**

As mentioned above, Sia's best possible storage efficiency is 33.3%. For most of the test, Sia achieved an efficiency very close to this, at 33.0%.

This indicates that the test was successful at crafting input files that maximized Sia's storage efficiency. With files of exactly 41942760 bytes bytes (~40 MiB), Sia does not need to add padding to the files

**Efficiency plummeted after Sia's restart**

I took a look at my [renter.log](https://gist.github.com/mtlynch/05c632207dfa1672cf791e1ab5b25f99#file-renter-log) file and saw that for the first 

**Final efficiency was worse than tests with real data**

The [previous test](/load-test-2/) finished with a storage efficiency of 28.3%, while this test finished significantly below that, at 21.5%.

This strongly suggests bugs in Sia. In each of the load tests, there have been sudden drops in efficiency. Sia seems to aggressively reupload data more frequently than it has to.

Alternatively, this could be the result of host luck, but this is very unlikely. For the first ten days of the test, Sia experienced nearly

This could be due to poor luck. It's possible that this test happened to choose less reliable hosts and had to upload data more frequently. But

## Upload bandwidth

The test uploaded 1.5 TiB of file data in 336.0 hours. That's equivalent to an overall average upload bandwidth of 11.2 Mbps.

*Note: Bandwidth measurements in this test are non-rigorous due to the limitations of my test infrastructure. I ran these tests on my home  FiOS connection. My ISP offers no bandwidth guarantees, and I also used my connection for other bandwidth-intensive activities while the test was in progress. Sia would likely show higher bandwidth on an uncontested, server-grade network link.*

## API latency

All the metrics shown in this report come from three Sia daemon APIs that [sia_metrics_collector](https://github.com/mtlynch/sia_metrics_collector) polls:

* `/renter/contracts`
* `/renter/files`
* `/wallet`

The API latency is the total amount of time required to call these three APIs in sequence:

## Test notes

* Sia v1.3.2 was [released](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/releases/tag/v1.3.2) before this began. While all cases in this load test used 1.3.1 for consistency, the 1.3.2 release may affect results as hosts upgrade to the latest Sia version.
* The metrics collector crashed at XXXZ (at the XX hours elapsed mark). It was down for approximately XX minutes.

## Reproducing results

All steps to reproduce these results are available in the [sia_load_tester](https://github.com/mtlynch/sia_load_tester/blob/2802acc77d6651bec88cf954c5240197bc6d9627/README.md) README.
